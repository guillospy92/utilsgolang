/*2. Write a console tic-tac-toe game

The game should allow you to play against the machine, the machine can be as “dumb” or “sophisticated” as you wish, for every turn the game should display the current board status and should wait for the input of the next move, to indicate a move the player can write the number of the column and row (separated by a “,”), the game should validate the player move and when someone wins the game should stop and indicate if the player or the machine had won.

An execution should look something line this:

+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
|   | X |   |
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+

Write your next move and press enter: 1,1

+---+---+---+
| O |   |   |
+---+---+---+
|   | X |   |
+---+---+---+
| X |   |   |
+---+---+---+

Write your next move and press enter: 1,6

Ops!, that cell doesn't exists, try again: 1,2

+---+---+---+
| O | O | X |
+---+---+---+
|   | X |   |
+---+---+---+
| X |   |   |
+---+---+---+

GAME OVER!!!

Machine wins!
Aditional instructions

All the writing should be realized in this tab, do not write your code in another place and then paste it here, since this tool allow us to rewatch your writing process (primary as an anti fraud measure)

This test doesn’t have a time limit, but if you choose to start an exercise you should have the time to complete it without interruption, because time will be taken as a performance indicator.

Code complexity, readability and efficiency will be evaluated as well, so please write nice code, not just working code.

You can select whatever programming language you feel comfortable using (as long as it is include between the options platform brings you)

You can use the internet to solve doubts if you have any. (for example, if you had forgotten how to add an element to a list in javascript, you can open a tab and look for it)*/
